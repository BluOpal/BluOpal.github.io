		<h1>My Goals.</h1>
		<div>
			<p class="explanation">
				Who does not want to have fine jewelry at affordable prices? I do, but I
				noticed that every time I go to different stores looking for a real gem
				necklace, earrings, or bracelets, the prices were expensive ranging from
				$50.00 or more. With that in mind, I decided to starting making my own
				semi-precious stone ornaments. Quickly I realize that a nice piece
				of jewel can be made for a fraction of the retail price. Moreover, I
				noticed that while making it, I discovered it is my passion and I really
				enjoy creating pieces of necklaces that are classy and can be used for
				any occasion. That is when I started my own company back in 2019.
			</p>
			<p class="explanation">
				My goal is that every woman who does not
				have the budget to buy expensive jewelry can find it at an affordable
				price. All my jewelry is handmade using sterling silver and
				semiprecious stones like agate, moonlight, jasper, quartz, amethyst,
				topaz, citrine, turquoise, among others. When I am crafting, I always
				pay attention to every detail and ask myself, “Would I use this piece. How often?”
			</p>
			<p class="explanation">
				My future plan is to expand my business, make my products
				more widely known, include more pieces of jewels, rings, and earrings to my collections.
