				<h2>Design:</h2>
				<p>
					First, the outline and style of a jewelry piece is brainstormed and planned. 
					Designs are made to champion beauty and simplicity. 
					For Necklaces, the stones are carefully considered before bought, based on clarity, charm, and demand. 
					Much of the jewelry is made with sterling silver wire, clasps, beads, and pendants. 
					The stones and beads must be balanced. For instance, large stones are balanced with small sterling silver beads. 
					Additionally, much of Blue Opal's jewelry is inspired by native and modern designs. 
				</p>

			<div class="column">
				<h2>Testing:</h2>
				<p>
					The necklaces are then examined and experimented with different types of clothing. 
					More traditional looking necklaces are tested to see if they pair up nicely with traditional, formal dresses. 
					Simple, modern designs are tested with casual clothing. 
					If jewelry is not in harmony with clothing, then the design of the jewelry is evaluated and redetermined. 
					As a company, Blue Opal makes sure to offer beautiful and refined jewelry to their clients. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<h2>Technology:</h2>
				<p>
					Much of Blue Opal's jewelry uses high quality .925 sterling silver. 
					This is an alloy of silver that includes 92.5% silver and 7.5% zinc. 
					As a result of the mixture, sterling silver is durable and is less prone to tarnishing than other metals. 
					Another of the key features in Blue Opal's jewelry is the clasps. 
					A clasp is a device used to join together the two ends of a necklace. 
					The three types of clasps that are used in the jewelry are toggle clasps, barrel clasp, and S-hook clasps. 
					Toggle clasps are the most common type of clasps used in our jewelry and consist of a ring that catches a bar. 
					Barrel clasps are small cylinders that fasten to each other. S-hook clasps are S-shaped hooks that attach to each other.
